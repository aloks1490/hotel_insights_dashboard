- **Dynamic Visualizations**: Intuitive charts, graphs, and visuals to monitor performance trends.  
- **Key Metrics**:  
  - Occupancy rate  
  - Average daily rate (ADR)  
  - Revenue per available room (RevPAR)  
  - Customer satisfaction scores  
  - Booking sources (e.g., direct, third-party platforms)  
- **Filters and Interactivity**: Customizable filters for location, time range, room types, etc.  
- **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmark current performance against historical data or industry standards.  

## üóÇÔ∏è Workflow  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Gather data from multiple sources (e.g., booking systems, customer reviews, financial data).  
2. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Clean and preprocess raw data using tools like Excel or SQL.  
   - Transform data into a Power BI-friendly format.  
3. **Data Modeling**:  
   - Create relationships between tables for seamless reporting.  
   - Implement calculated columns and measures using DAX.  
4. **Dashboard Design**:  
   - Use Power BI to design an engaging, user-friendly interface.  
   - Integrate KPIs, visualizations, and slicers for interactivity.  
5. **Deployment**:  
   - Publish the dashboard to the Power BI Service for sharing and collaboration.  
   - Schedule data refreshes for up-to-date reporting.  

## üìä Tools & Technologies
